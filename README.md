# AMX Mod X Base Linux Binaries

[AMX Mod X](https://github.com/alliedmodders/amxmodx) is a Metamod plugin for Half-Life 1. It provides comprehensive scripting for the game engine and its mods. Scripts can intercept network messages, log events, commands, client commands, set cvars, modify entities, and more. AMX Mod X also has a system for extending native scripting through modules, leading to outside support for things like MySQL and Sockets.
